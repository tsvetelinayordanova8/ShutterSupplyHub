    <string name="product_description">The EOS 90D is built around a 32.5 MP APS-C sensor, giving the lens
        a zoom range of 1.6 times that of a full-frame camera. A great choice for sports and wildlife
        photographers: capture incredibly detailed images at speed of 10 fps with continuous focus. Support for UHS-II SD memory cards allows the
        camera to record images quickly and shoot up to 58 full-size JPEG files, 25 RAW files or 39 CRAW
        files in one shot.</string>
